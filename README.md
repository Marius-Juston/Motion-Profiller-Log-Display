# Motion Profiller Log Display
Displays the Walton Robotics Log files as graphs for simple and quick troubleshooting
## Why to use
PID tunning is hard to do and visulaizing what the robot was meant to do compared to what the robot actually did is something that is very helpfull for troubleshooting problems.
This program is meant to visualise the logs created by Walton Robotics <a href=https://github.com/ThundrHawk/Actually-Simple-Splines>Actually-Simple-Splines</a> repository which includes a custom PID loop and motion that are easy to utilize.
